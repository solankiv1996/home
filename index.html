    <h3> Projects </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Currently, I am working on designing experiments for circuit breakers inclined at an angle interconnected with surge arresters at a different altitude through flexible conductors to determine their seismic response. The design requires the use of Eigen Realization Algorithm (ERA) to investigate the natural frequencies, damping ratios and modal shapes critical for the system under consideration.</li>
        <li>An experimental setup developed to  determine the moment curvature relationsip of different types of conductors.</li>
        <li>Seismic response of five storey steel frame with different damping devices such as ringfeder and wirerope was studied.</li>
        <li>Development of constitutive model of tension and compression for Ultra High Performance Concrete based on experiments at SEESL</li>
        <li>Captured the uncertainty in the value of horizontal seismic coefficient to determine the seismic forces acting on retaining wall structures and propose a load factor for seismic forces.</li>
        <li>Collected and compiled data on impact of earthquakes on masonry buildings in Chile and USA as part of EERI collection.</li>
